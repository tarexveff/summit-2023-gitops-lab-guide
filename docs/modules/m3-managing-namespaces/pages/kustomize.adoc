# Managing Namespaces using Kustomize and GitOps

‚è±Ô∏è _Estimated Time: 10 Minutes_

üë®‚Äçüíª _Role: Cluster Administrator_

Now that you've got the basics figured out, you can start managing some Namespaces. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/[Namespaces] can be used to provide isolation, and divide resources between different teams within a Kubernetes cluster. For example, two teams could each be given a Namespace within a cluster to deploy their applications. Each Namespace can have a set amount of CPU and memory allocated to it depending on the requirements of the software each team is building and deploying. The members of each team might only have access to their own Namespace and no additional namespaces.

In this section, you'll create two Namespaces based on a shared template. Of course you'll want each Namespace to have a unique name, and custom https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/[ResourceQuotas] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/[LimitRanges] depending on the workloads being deployed within them. You'll learn how to extend and patch YAML files using https://kustomize.io/[Kustomize]. Argo CD supports both Kustomize and Helm for scenarios where templating YAML is necessary.

Another use-case for YAML templating is patching resources based on the target environment. This example image from the Kustomize website shows how a Deployment's replica count can be scaled out depending on the target environment.

== Examine the Base Resources

You'll be using Kustomize to build out your Namespaces based on a shared template. The repository you made a copy of has included the template files to save some time. 

. Navigate to the _https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/blob/main/managed-namespaces/base[managed-namespaces/base, window=_blank]_ folder in your repository.
. View the contents of the _namespace.yaml_ and _resource-quota.yaml_ files. These are resources that can be applied to a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` annotations on the YAML resources control the order in which they will be applied by Argo CD. These annotations are related to a concept known as https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-waves/[Sync Waves]. Utilising Sync Waves is important in this example, since the Namespace needs to exist before other resources can be applied within it.
====
. Open the _https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/blob/main/managed-namespaces/base/kustomization.yaml[managed-namespaces/base/kustomization.yaml, window=_blank]_ file. This file references the _namespace.yaml_ and _resource-quota.yaml_ files.

These files are referred to as *bases* or the *base* files to be used by Kustomize. In the next steps you'll define *overlays* that extend/modify the base configuration(s).

== Define a Namespace using Overlays

A Namespace is already defined in the _https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/blob/main/managed-namespaces/overlays/project-memes-dev[managed-namespaces/overlays/project-memes-dev, window=_blank]_ folder. You'll use this as a template to make a second Namespace:

. Navigate to https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/[the root, window=_blank] your copy of the GitHub repository.
. Press the period/dot key to open GitHub's web-based editor.
+
. Create a *folder* named `project-memes-prod` inside the _managed-namespaces/overlays/_ folder. This folder will contain your Namespace configuration.
. Create a *file* named `kustomization.yaml` inside your _managed-namespaces/overlays/project-memes-prod_ folder.
+

. Place the following content in _managed-namespaces/overlays/project-memes-prod/kustomization.yaml_. This will use the base files, but replace the default Namespace value and double the ResourceQuota values:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

namespace: project-memes-prod
bases:
- ../../base

# Patches are edits to make to a set of one or more targets
patches:
# This patch targets the Namespace resource and changes the
# value of metadata.name to "project-memes-prod"
- target:
    kind: Namespace
    name: for-replacement
  patch: |-
    - op: replace
      path: /metadata/name
      value: project-memes-prod
# This patch targets the resource quota. It doubles the available
# resources compared to the default values
- target:
    kind: ResourceQuota
    name: resource-quota-memory-cpu
  patch: |-
    - op: replace
      path: /spec/hard/cpu
      value: 1
    - op: replace
      path: /spec/hard/memory
      value: 1Gi
----
. Edit the `kustomization.yaml` file in the _managed-namespaces/overlays/_ folder to reference your new Namespace configuration. It should now look like this:
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
bases:
- ./project-memes-dev
- ./project-memes-prod
----
. The end result will be a new _managed-namespaces/overlays/project-memes-prod/kustomization.yaml_ file, and the existing _managed-namespaces/overlays/kustomize.yaml_ is updated to reference the new _project-memes-prod/_ folder as shown:
+
image::ex4.github-ide-namespace-files.png[]
. Edit the `spec.source.repoURL` in _etc/managed-namespaces.application.yaml_ to point to your repository's URL.
+
image::ex4.github-ide-application-cr.png[]
. Use the *Source Control* section of the GitHub editor to enter a commit message, then press *Commit & Push*.
+

You now have two Namespaces ready to be synchronised and managed by Argo CD on your OpenShift cluster. You also have the Application CR required by Argo CD.
